# BEAM-Messenger
The messenger with that certain something.  
Just a task for me to create my own messenger with integrated social network like features.
It's not my aim to create a **popular** messenger/social network.  
### The things the messenger should/will feature
* Easy interface
* Fast responses
* Secure backend
* **NO** data-selling
* Free to use (except for donations :) )
* Open source
* Realtime end-to-end encrypted chat
* Image uploading
* Status and/or story feature
* Friend and followers
* Groups in chats **and** in image feed
### File placements
* Main site code is in `/main/app/sprinkles/core/`
* The Twig templates of the actual site you'll see are in `/main/app/sprinkles/core/templates/pages/`
* Other important things are mostly somewhere in the `sprinkles` directory - other directories are mostly configuration, logs, cache etc.

### Decentralized version
* I'm currently also working on a decentralized version of this network - you can find my work in the branch "decentralized".

### Help me with a small donation :)
